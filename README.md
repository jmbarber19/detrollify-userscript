# What is This?
A userscript to translate the translatable troll Pesterchum "quirks" from Homestuck.

* CG
* TC
* AC
* TA

### Show Troll

Unfortunately, all troll chatlogs are hand-written by the author of Homestuck, Andrew Hussie, and thus don't necessarily follow hard and fast rules. This means that Detrollify can't correct all of them perfectly. In those cases, fear not! Hover over a line of troll chat and you'll see the "Show Troll" link appear to the right. Clicking it will Re-trollify the line, letting you see it in its original glory.
